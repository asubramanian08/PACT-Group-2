# Pact Group 2

I really enjoyed my second year in [PACT](https://algorithmicthinking.org/overview) as part of their group 2 with Dr. Rajiv Gandhi (see my work for [group 1](https://github.com/asubramanian08/PACT-Group-1)). I joined about 25 other people in group 2 during the summer of 2022. I didn't attend the year round program (due to a scheduling conflict), so normally I wouldn't be allowed to join group 2. Since I was really eager to join group 2 and dive deeper into theoretical CS, I independently studied the [year round material](https://g.co/kgs/4D6Ewu). Dr. Gandhi then assessed my understanding and determined that I was eligible for group 2! :)

## Group 2 description

Group 2 studies more advanced topics in theoretical computer science, specifically approximation and randomization algorithms. See exactly what topics are covered in the Topics column of [Class Materials](https://github.com/asubramanian08/PACT-Group-2#class-materials). I wanted to continue with PACT since I really enjoyed group 1 and CS Theory is REALLY interesting.

As part of group 2, I got to mentor 6 of the group 1 students. I remember how helpful my mentor was in group 1. Since the topics were new to me, I asked my mentor a lot of questions to clarify the topics. I hope I did as good of a job mentoring as my group 1 mentor did.

## Class Materials

The following is a table used to break down all the materials and supplements for each day. It is a way to organize all the necessary resources per day. NOTE: Many links won't be usable by the public in order to not give away other people work. Specifically, the "lecture materials" and "additional reading" sections are not available for the public.

Additional info:
* For all WS in the Additional Reading section use [this](https://www.designofapproxalgs.com/book.pdf) for the book *The Design of Approximation Algorithms* by Williamson and Shmoys.
* VV in the Additional Reading section refer to Vijay Vazirani's *Approximation Algorithms* book.
* *Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis* book by Mitzenmacher and Upfal is written as MU in the Additional Reading section.
* All recording passwords are located [here](RecordingPasswords.md) (private file).
